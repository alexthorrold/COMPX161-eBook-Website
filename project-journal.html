                    Design Sketches:
                    Sketched possible designs for the cover, about, contents, and 
                    main pages.
                    <br>
                    Fonts:
                    Found fonts for my headings and body from Google Fonts.
                    <br>
                    Colors:
                    Decided to use white on black as the genre is mystery, which is 
                    well represented by using black as the dominant color.

                    Created the cover page of my web page – my plan originally was to 
                    use the sprite shown below, with the bottom sprite appearing when 
                    you hovered over the bottom right corner. I had some trouble 
                    implementing this and eventually decided that it would be more 
                    clear to the reader to just use the bottom part at all times.

                    Received feedback from Phil regarding how to improve my 
                    website, he suggested:
                    <br>
                    Add more content (e.g. synopsis) to the about page
                    <br>
                    Decrease words per line and increase typeface size
                    <br>
                    Make side navigation buttons more obvious
                    <br>
                    Implement a button to return to the top of the page
                    <br>
                    Add a comment to say who wrote it and why
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <span class="date">08/09</span>
                    <br>
                    Implemented some of the suggestions that Phil suggested, I decreased the words per line to approximately 12 per line, and increased the typeface size accordingly. I felt like this resulted in the typeface being too large so I decreased line width and typeface slightly to retain 12 words per line while decreasing typeface size.
                    <br>
                    Added a white outline of a triangle around the previous/next page navigation buttons so that the user doesn’t have to hover over them to realise they’re there.

                    Planned two interactive elements, one of which will be implemented.
                </p>
                <p class="heading">Interactive Element 1 – Explanation boxes</p>
                <p>
                    Because Sherlock Holmes is an old book, some of the words used are less 
                    common today. This feature would allow the user to hover over select words 
                    or phrases to have a definition appear in a box.

                <p class="heading">Interactive Element 2 – Interactive quiz</p>
                <p>
                    This feature would allow the user to take a quiz on Sherlock Holmes trivia. 
                    The user would click one of the answers. If it is the correct answer, the 
                    clicked answer would turn green, if it is a wrong answer, the clicked answer 
                    would turn red.

                    <br>
                    After receiving feedback at the critique session, I’ve decided to implement the second interactive element, the quiz.

                <p>
                    <span class="date">01/10</span>
                    <br>
                    Began implementing the JavaScript quiz into my project, I’ve added buttons 
                    for questions as well as a next question button, and created functions to 
                    set colour based on whether the answer is right or wrong. Moving to the 
                    next question and changing the correct button still needs to be implemented, 
                    as well as making design decisions to make the quiz fit the aesthetic of the 
                    website.
                    <br>
                    I also still need to improve content on the about page.

                    <br>
                    Finished designing the quiz and added more questions. Based on feedback from 
                    the critique session, I added a results page at the end and ability to 
                    reattempt.
                    <br>
                    I also added a synopsis and about the author section to the about page as was 
                    recommended at the checkpoint.

                    Changed main chapter text to use vmax instead of px, so content will fit 
                    various screen sizes. Set to approximately 10-12 words per line, as recommended, 
                    which involved making the typeface larger, as well as slightly decreasing paragraph width.

                    As mentioned above, I originally planned to use a sprite as my cover 
                    image, however I realised that not indicating that the bottom right 
                    corner could be clicked on when not hovered was a bad idea, as it could 
                    be missed by the user.

                <p class="bold">Header font selection</p>
                <p>
                    In my original design for the critique as shown below, I used a cursive font 
                    in my header, and had two lines of header, one for the adventure number, and 
                    one for the adventure name. After receiving poor feedback on this design's 
                    aesthetic, I instead used my current header font, and combined the two header 
                    lines into one.
